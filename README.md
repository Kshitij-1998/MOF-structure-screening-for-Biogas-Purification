# MOF-structure-screening-for-Biogas-Purification
The inefficiency of current biogas synthesis methods is an unfortunate reality that has stifled biogas 
as a major source of energy as mankind continues the search for a viable alternative to fossil fuels. 
Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous membrane-like materials that hold the potential to 
revolutionise the process of biogas purification. However, designing these materials is a tedious task 
due to an infinite number of possible MOF combinations. Trying to identify the structures that have 
suitable properties for biogas purification using conventional lab methods would be an arduous and 
nearly unfeasible task. Using the foundation laid by computation chemistry screening methods, this 
project attempts to use machine learning to identify useful MOF structures from a much larger 
dataset without the need for any lab work.
